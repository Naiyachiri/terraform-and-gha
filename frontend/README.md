# Porfolio Application

React Application that is representative of the porfolio web application that will be deployed using our CI/CD Pipeline

This will include Unit tests and present a react replica of the naiyachiri.github.io portfolio git pages website

## Decisions:

### AXIOS
  - for simplicity we opted to follow the guide and use AXIOS. Projects I personally work on usually use redux, and thus would preferentially use redux-thunk or else redux sagas to deal with APIs, but that would require a decent amount of setup and boiler plate that would deviate from the objective of this exercise
