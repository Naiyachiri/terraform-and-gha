# terraform-and-gha
Today gentlefolk we come together to learn to use terraform with github actions

Some goal-ish parameters for our study:

1. Terraform should be oriented in a workspaces/ child modules and parent modules setup
2. Github actions should be used integratively with terraform to deploy infrastructure to AWS
3. Terraform Cloud should be leveraged in order to make use of their UI and workspaces

*We want to recreate our OG portfolio, implement a CI/CD Pipeline for it using the free AWS and Terraform Cloud features.*
